sovity's implementation of the Dynamic Attribute Provisioning Service (DAPS) based on the Keycloak IAM platform.

{% hint style="danger" %} 
DAPS must be used together with the DSPortal. There is no standalone support for DAPS offered by sovity.

## Getting Started

There is an example deployment using Docker Compose, which will automatically build everything on startup.
To use it, copy the file `.env.example` to `.env`
and assign secure secrets, as described in the file.
This setup uses PostgreSQL; however, any database supported by Keycloak can be used.

The setup is configured for a local deployment using plaintext HTTP on port 8080.
For a production environment behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy,
the following environment variable adjustments are needed:

- `KC_PROXY=edge`
- `KC_HOSTNAME=keycloak.example.com`

Additionally, the `start-dev` command should be removed from the `docker-compose.yml`.

Further configuration options can be found in the official [Keycloak documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-config).

## Realm Configuration

For least friction, it is recommended to create a separate realm, commonly named "DAPS".
In this new realm, several modifications to pre-existing global defaults need to be made:

- Change all pre-existing client scopes to type "None"
- Create a new client scope of type "Optional" with name `idsc:IDS_CONNECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ALL`

If you want to use any service accounts to automate configuration management,
it is best to create them before this point.
If you do it later, you will need to manually reassign at least the `roles` scope to any such clients.

## Managing Participants

Participants are represented as Keycloak service accounts.
These should have the "DAT Mapper", a custom protocol mapper implemented in this project,
configured and assigned to them.

For simple management, it is recommended
to use our [Authority Portal](https://github.com/sovity/authority-portal) project.
